Mu-8: Visualizing Differences between a Protein and its Family
======

*More information on this project and the latest released version is available at http://mu-8.com*



The objective of the Mu-8 project is to develop and interactive visualization technique that is capable of helping biologists identify mutations that affect protein function. The specific problem used for the development of the tool was the assessment of a [defective triosephosphate isomerase (TIM)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21839742) published as part of the [2013 IEEE BioVis Contest](http://www.biovis.net/year/2013/info/contest).
