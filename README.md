BioVis Tool - Contest Submission for 3rd IEEE Symposium on Biological Data Visualization

Introduction
========

The objective of this **BioVis** project was to develop a methodology and visualization that is capable of helping biologists identify mutations that affect protein function. The specific problem used for the development of the tool was the assessment of a [defective triosephosphate isomerase (TIM)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21839742).
